# About
Danmaku (Bullet Hell) 2D video game I made for my engineering degree. The game consits of a brief sequence where you have to kill the enemy three times while dodging bullets. It's more of a tech demo, therefore it's a bit lacking on the graphics side (no backgrounds, basic copyright-free assets, etc.)

Technologies used:
* C++
* cocos2d-x

# How to install?

Prerequisites:
* Python 2.7.x
* CMake

Steps:

1. Add system environment variables so that `python` and `cmake` are recognizable cmd commands
2. Clone the repo
3. Run install_cocos.bat
4. Compile and run the project
